# A Guide to Ruby on Rails API

An expanded guide to the Ruby on Rails API found at https://api.rubyonrails.org/

The docs here are the same as the official API docs, but expanded to includes footnotes, extra code examples and elaborations on terms and concepts.

These docs were made with the help of ChatGPT, so accuracy of code examples can't be guaranteed.
